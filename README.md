The Sermon Formulator


This is a long term project which will probably just be a hobby. Here are the intended stages of building this:

~~Stage 0: Make a list of things that will never happen

Stage 1: Build the program, probably in Electron, that:

1. Lets you select a "main" Bible passage (as little as one verse)
2. Asks you questions about the verse (e.g. Who is the author? Who was the original audience? What is the broader context? What is the main point?)
3. Automatically adds cross references (potentially could act like an "autocorrect".)
4. Continually autosaves

Stage 2:
1. Add ability to automatically generate a slideshow

Longer term (if that's even possible)
 Add features for users who live in hostile and restricted areas like
 1. Any internet usage in-app goes through a proxy
 2. Saving to the cloud forces encryption. This would have to use a crossplatform core like cryptomator, or maybe there are others. We are only in the theory stage sooo
 3. "Incognito mode" that changes the program to a Calculator app. Entering the right code opens the app. Entering the self-destruct code removes any trace of the program. Entering anything else just acts like a calculator.


Caveats:
 Due to the nature of this, even though it will be open source, I would expect most people would want to use a digitally signed version.
 I fear the use of Electron may include vulnerabilities by shear amount of code but I don't know, I also don't have time to make a native crossplatform app soooo there
 This will probably take me a long time to have anything to show for it since I'm just learning anyway
